# Fishing
Fishing is a skill which involves catching fish from selected spots around Gielinor. Higher Fishing levels enable different mechanisms of Fishing, the ability to catch a larger selection of fish and increases a player's catch rate. Caught fish may be cooked through the Cooking skill to create food which may be used later to regain hitpoints during combat. Alternatively, many players sell their excess stock of catches for 

## Equipment:
Bait fishing: Fishing rod and some fishing bait.
Fly fishing: Fly fishing rod and feathers for bait.

## Fishing rods and bait
### Regular Rods and regular bait
Can be used in both rivers and seas. Along with a fishing rod, players also need bait. Bait can be bought in stores ($3 coins each at the Port Sarim fishing shop), but is also dropped by some monsters. For every fish you catch, you lose one piece of bait.

There is also an oily fishing rod. It is required to catch lava eels and is needed in the Heroes' Quest.

### Fly Fishing Rods and feathers
Fly fishing rods are required for mid level fishing. These rods can only be used in rivers. Along with a fly fishing rod, players also need feathers. They can be bought from the Shilo Village and Port Sarim fishing shop, but are also dropped by chickens. When a player has found a fishing spot, they can then use their fly fishing rod if the option "lure fishing spot" is available.

Stripy feathers (introduced with the Hunter skill) can be used for fly fishing, as well. Those feathers work the same as normal feathers, but players will only be able to fish rainbow fish, rather than the usual trout and salmon.

## Barbarian Fishing
Players with a level 48 in Fishing can speak with Otto Godblessed in his home near Baxtorian Falls to learn special barbarian methods of fishing. First, he instructs the player on heavy rod fishing. Heavy rod fishing requires a barbarian rod (found under Otto's bed) and any type of bait (except for stripy/coloured feathers), as well as a knife to gut the fish. In order to catch the special fish in Otto's lake, a Strength and Agility level is needed in addition to the fishing requirement. The leaping fish obtained can be used with a sword or knife to obtain roe and caviar for use in the Herblore skill, and catching them gives small amounts of experience in Strength and Agility.
